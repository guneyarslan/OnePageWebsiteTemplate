# OnePageWebsiteTemplate
<br><br>
All of it have been prepared with "Bootstrap5", with the documentation and examples they share on their own websites. <br><br>

This is my very first website. It's just a basic template. Of course, more can be developed and added features. Since it was my first job, I didn't want to push myself too much. I wrote all the bootstrap codes myself. I took the javascript code from chatgpt and edited it. <br><br>

I thought of it as a static promotional website for a tourism company. But I think it will fit a lot of things. It can also be a very nice blog page. Please feel free to use it and modify it. You can also give a star if you like it and make my day happier. ### Thank you.
